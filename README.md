Retinal optical coherence tomography has been identified as biomarker for disease progression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), while the dynamics of retinal atrophy in progressive MS are less clear. We investigated retinal layer thickness changes in 195 RRMS, 125 primary and 87 secondary progressive MS (PPMS, SPMS) patients, and their prognostic value for disease activity.

The green section demonstrates complementary views on the estimation of thickness change rates (longitudinal and cross-sectional) and for the prediction of disability progression by retinal layer thickness

In order to analyze the effect of time (disease duration) on retinal layer thickness, we present multiple approaches, each providing a unique perspective on estimation of retinal thickness change rates. With the baseline LMMs (Figure 2), we present an exclusively cross-sectional approach to estimate thickness change rates and complement it using non-linear spline regressions to capture potential non-linear thickness change rates (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, we present two approaches that measure only longitudinal effects, with the BLUPs being based on an overall LMM (Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Table 6) and the eye-wise OLS on separate models for each eye (Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Table 7). Thus, BLUPs of thickness change rates consider a larger sample by also respecting overall thickness change rates, while the OLS approach focuses exclusively on estimating overall thickness change rates for each eye separately. Therefore, BLUPs provide a lower variance estimation of thickness change, which also causes smaller differences in estimates across patients. These differences in thickness change are better captured by eye-wise OLS, which in turn suffers from higher variance in estimates.
In addition to providing both complementary views on the estimation of thickness change rates (longitudinal and cross-sectional), we also present models that include both types of effects. Namely, we present a regular LMM (Supplementary Table 3) estimating linear thickness change rates across the entire sample as well as a LMM with the non-linear spline representation of the effect of disease duration (Figure 3).
